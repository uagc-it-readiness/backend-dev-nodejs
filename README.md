# Backend Web Development w/Node.js Course Materials

Section Two of the University of Arkansas Global Campus IT Readiness classes have started, so we have taken this repo down to limit the access of current students to class materials. If you are a former student and would like a copy of the class materials, please reach out to the current instructors, Brenna Blackwell (brennablackwell@gmail.com) or Spruce Feinstein (sprucefeinstein@gmail.com) and we will provide you with a copy of the repo. Thank you for your understanding in this matter.
